- [EmoMusicTV]([https://caihanlin.com/blogs/21yrs](https://github.com/Tayjsl97/EmoMusicTV))<br>
EmoMusicTV is a transformer-based variational autoencoder (VAE) that contains a hierarchical latent variable structure to model holistic properties of the music segments and short-term variations within bars. The piece-level and bar-level emotional labels are embedded in their corresponding latent spaces to guide music generation. EmoMusicTV can adapt to multiple music generation tasks and performs well, e.g., melody harmonization, melody generation given harmony, and lead sheet generation.
